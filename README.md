Aim: To learn and implement data types in C++.

Tools: V S Code or any IDE.

Theory:

1 int (Integer) Stores whole numbers (no decimals) Example: int age = 20;

2 char (Character) Stores a single character Enclosed in single quotes ('A', '5') Example: char grade = 'A';

3 double Stores decimal numbers with double precision (more accurate than float) Example: double pi = 3.14159;

4 string Stores a sequence of characters (words or sentences) Requires #include Example: string name = "Ananya";

5 float Stores decimal numbers with single precision Less accurate than double, uses less memory Example: float temp = 36.6f; (note the f)

6 bool (Boolean) Stores true or false Used in conditions and logic Example: bool isPassed = true;

Conclusion: We learnt about the basic data types supported by C++ and how to use them .
